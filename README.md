# MashWin
 Subclass of a Form for custom theme'ing and design, has a great many customization options.
 
 In the designer, under properties, is a new category of settings called "ExtendedSettings"- These allow for near infinite customization of the forms
 
 WndProc is also intercepted and OS calls are passed/handled so that dragging/resizing are handled via the OS and .NET, rather than the slow/clunky manual resizing methods.. Meaning the forms are fast and responsive, with no noticable performance impact over a native window
 
 Below is just a small example of what's possible with MWindow.  There's also an included class called "RoundButton" that can be imported via 'using MashWin;', giving access to all the forms and controls.
 



I *HIGHLY* recommend ObjectListView as an addition to this tool for truly unique and creative forms, without having to delve into XML and WPF (I hate both, lol)
